            <p>October 19, 2025</p>
            <p>
                As a Research Assistant at <a href="https://ctdatahaven.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DataHaven</a>, I analyzed the effect of federal budget cuts to SNAP (sometimes called food stamps) at the town and legislative district level in Connecticut. I used a simple model to calculate local impacts, visualized the results with R, researched the specific policy changes, and wrote up this report. I also wrote a <a href="https://ctdatahaven.org/report/understanding-how-snap-impacts-connecticut-communities-through-new-data-datahaven-and-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">companion piece</a> explaining the available data on Connecticut SNAP impacts.

            <p>December 12, 2024</p>
            <p>
                For my senior Statistics & Data Science thesis at Yale, I modeled the changing effect of ideology, partisanship, and constituent material interests (as represented by district fossil fuel jobs) on House environmental voting in an era of increasing polarization (1989-2016). To do so, I estimated the fossil fuel jobs in each member's district during each Congress in the time period, and created a dataset merging fossil fuel job, environmental voting, NOMINATE, and member characteristics data, which I hope could be useful for other analyses.
